# Dashboard and Content Pages

Content pages as well as the dashboard page are standard Pimcore documents. Their content structure and content 
itself can be populated with area bricks and all the standard concepts known from the Pimcore documents.

Content pages can be added everywhere it the portal - they can be part of the main navigation as well as any sub pages
or even hidden pages that are only reachable via teasers and other links.
