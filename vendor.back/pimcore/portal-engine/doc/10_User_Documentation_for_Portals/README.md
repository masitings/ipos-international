# User Documentation 

Portals can be **Asset Experience Portals** or **Product Experience Portals** (or both) and deliver any data that is 
managed within Pimcore assets and/or data objects. 

What data is available in a portal is defined with data pools. Each data pool contains a subset of assets or data objects
and provides certain features and interaction possibilities (download, editing, ...) to the user. One portal can have
multiple data pools configured.

This user documentation describes the out-of-the-box features of portals and data pools for assets and data objects. 
Details and certain features might differ due to customizations and extensions.
